A customizable code formatter for the C3 language, written in C3.

## Usage

Usage:
```bash
c3fmt [<options>] <files/directories>
```
Options:
```
-h, --help       - Show this help.
-v, --version    - Show current version.
--in-place       - Format files in place.
--stdin          - Read input from stdin.
--stdout         - Output result to stdout.
--config=<path>  - Specify a config file.
--default        - Force default config.
--check          - Finish with error if files are not formatted.
```

## Configuration

`c3fmt` will try to find a `.c3fmt` configuration file inside the working directory. You can also pass your own path to `c3fmt` using the `--config` flag, or force the default configuration with `--default`.

You can look at [.c3fmt](.c3fmt) for the default configuration.

### Available Options

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `use_tabs` | Use tabs for indentation. | `true` |
| `tab_size` | The width of a tab character. | `4` |
| `indent_width` | The number of spaces to use for indentation (if `use_tabs` is false). | `4` |
| `max_blank_line_between_statements` | Maximum number of blank lines to preserve between statements. | `2` |
| `max_line_length` | Maximum line length before wrapping. | `120` |
| `brace_style` | The brace style to use: `ALLMAN` or `K&R`. | `ALLMAN` |
| `else_on_newline` | Whether to put `else` on a new line. | `true` |
| `align_assignments` | Align `=` and `=>` in consecutive declarations/assignments. | `true` |
| `align_comments` | Align trailing comments in consecutive lines. | `true` |
## Building

Building requires the [C3 compiler](https://c3-lang.org/) and the [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter) SDK library. For instructions on how to build and install the tree-sitter library, refer to the [tree-sitter getting started guide](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/using-parsers/1-getting-started.html).

To build the executable:
```bash
c3c build
```

If the `tree-sitter` library is not in your system's default search path, you can specify the path using the `-L` flag:

```bash
c3c build -L /path/to/tree-sitter/lib
```

The binary will be located in `build/c3fmt`.

### Building Statically

You can build a fully static version of `c3fmt` (which is useful for standalone distribution) without needing `libtree-sitter` installed globally on your system.

First, build the static `tree-sitter` library:
```bash
c3c build build-ts-lib --trust=full
```

Then compile the static `c3fmt` binary:
```bash
c3c build c3fmt-static
```
The resulting static executable will be located in `build/c3fmt`.

### Updating Sources

You can keep the project dependencies and test data up-to-date using the built-in `prepare` targets:

*   **Tree-sitter Grammar:** Update the C3 grammar parser from upstream.
    ```bash
    c3c build update-grammar --trust=full
    ```
*   **Standard Library:** Sync `test/stdlib/src` with the latest C3 standard library for stability testing.
    ```bash
    c3c build update-stdlib --trust=full
    ```

## Tests

Run all tests using the C3 compiler:
```bash
c3c test
```

Just like with the build command, if `tree-sitter` is not in your search path, use the `-L` flag:
```bash
c3c test -L /path/to/tree-sitter/lib
```

The test suite includes:
- **Corpus**: Compares formatted output against expected `_f.c3` files.
- **Stability**: Ensures that formatting already-formatted code produces no changes (idempotency).
- **Stdlib**: Formats the entire C3 standard library and verifies that it still compiles and maintains the same syntax tree.

## Vendored libraries

- `src/opt.c3`: A vendored copy of [getopt.c3l](https://github.com/NotsoanoNimus/getopt.c3l).
- `lib/tree_sitter.c3l`: C3 bindings for the core tree-sitter SDK.
- `lib/tree_sitter_c3.c3l`: C3 grammar bindings for tree-sitter.

## Planned features / wishlist

- Wrapping indent option (ContinuationIndentWidth).
- Import sorting.
- Pointer alignment calibration.
